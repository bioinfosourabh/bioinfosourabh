## Research Focus

I specialize in high-throughput genomic analysis, precision diagnostics, and cloud-native bioinformatics. My work spans the development of scalable pipelines for whole exome/genome sequencing, machine learning models for variant prioritization, and integrative multi-omics frameworks for pediatric tumors and rare genetic disorders.

## Areas of Expertise

- **Computational Genomics**: WES, WGS, CNV/SV detection, somatic/germline variant calling  
- **NGS Pipeline Development**: Nextflow, Docker/Singularity, AWS, HPC environments  
- **Machine Learning in Genomics**: XGBoost, GNNs, Deep Learning, AI-based variant scoring  
- **Structural Bioinformatics**: Molecular dynamics (GROMACS), mutational modeling, docking  
- **Multi-Omics Integration**: scRNA-Seq, RNA-Seq, 16S metagenomics, ChIP-Seq
